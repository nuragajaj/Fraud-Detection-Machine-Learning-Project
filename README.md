# Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning.   It involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using **Python** and **XGBoost**.   The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine, even when the dataset is highly imbalanced.
